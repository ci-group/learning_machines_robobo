## Instructions for Installing and Running the Simulator

Follow these steps to install and run the robot simulator:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```pwsh
   git clone https://github.com/ci-group/learning_machines_robobo.git
   cd learning_machines_robobo
   ```

2. **Install Python 3.8:**
   - To ensure compatibility, use Python 3.8. If you don't have Python installed, consider using Anaconda.
    - If using Anaconda, download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
    
    ```powershell
    conda create -n learning_machines python=3.8
    conda activate learning_machines
    conda install -c conda-forge numpy
    conda install -c conda-forge opencv
    ```

    - For general Python users:

    ```powershell
    virtualenv lm_venv
    source lm_venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements. txt
    ```

3. **Install Docker (for Windows):**
   - Install WSL2.
   - Enable hardware virtualization.
   - Refer to [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) for assistance.

4. **Setup CoppeliaSim:**
   - Download the educational version of CoppeliaSim from their [website](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads).
    - Make sure to download the zip version for Windows.
    - Extract the contents to `learning_machines_robobo/examples/full_project_setup/CoppeliaSim`.

## Running the Simulator

Once everything is downloaded, you can start the simulator:

### 1. Update `scripts/setup.bash` with Your IP Address

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
(Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object { $_.AddressState -eq "Preferred" -and $_.ValidLifetime -lt "24:00:00" }).IPAddress
```

Update the line in `scripts/setup.bash`:

```powershell
export COPPELIA_SIM_IP="your.ip.address"
```

### 2. Start CoppeliaSim

Assuming you are currently in `learning_machines_robobo/examples/full_project_setup/`, run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\start_coppelia_sim.ps1 .\scenes\Robobo_Scene.ttt
```

*Note: The scene that CoppeliaSim starts with is specified here.*

### 3. Running the Code

- Launch Docker Engine.
- On PowerShell, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\run.ps1 --simulation
```

*Note: The executed code is located at `full_project_setup\catkin_ws\src\learning_machines\src\learning_machines\test_actions.py`.*

*Note: The docker build takes a while. After it successfully runs, you should see the Robobo move the phone, and the following in your terminal:*

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the setup.
