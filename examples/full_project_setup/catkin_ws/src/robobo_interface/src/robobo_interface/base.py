    It is advised to only use methods defined in this class when writing code,
    both for the hardware and for the simulation.

    A bunch of methods deal with "blocking", which is how to do simultaneous tasks.
    This is quite complex and has differences between the behaviour of hardware and simulation.

    To avoid this, never use a method that has a `blockid` parameter.
    All of these have sister methods that end in `_blocking` instead.
    This will prevent you from doing simultaneous tasks, but decrease complexity.
